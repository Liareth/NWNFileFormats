    // List. The game obtains the current Language ID from dialog.tlk, and then displays the ERF String whose
    // LanguageID matches the dialog.tlk language ID.

    // The String List contains a series of ERF String elements one after another. Note that each element has
    // a variable size, encoded within the element itself. The LanguageCount from the ERF Header specifies
    // the number of String List Elements.

    // The Key List consists of a series of Key structures one after another. Unlike the String List elements,
    // the Key List elements all have the same size. The EntryCount in the ERF header specifies the number
    // of Keys.

    // Each Key List Element has the following structure:

    char m_ResRef[16]; // Filename
    std::uint32_t m_ResId; // Resource ID, starts at 0 and increments
    Resource::ResourceType m_ResType; // File type
    std::byte m_Reserved[2];

    // The ResRef is the name of the file with no null terminator and in lower case. A ResRef can only
    // contain alphanumeric characters or underscores. It must have 1 to 16 characters, and if it contains less
    // than 16 characters, the remaining ones are nulls.

    // The ResID in the key structure is redundant, because the its possible to get the ResID for any ERF
    // Key by subtracting the OffsetToKeyList from its starting address and dividing by the size of a Key
    // List structure.

    // When a file is extracted from an ERF, the ResRef is the name of the file after it is extracted, and the
    // ResType specifies its file extension. For a list of ResTypes, see the section on ResTypes later in this
    // document.

    // elements
